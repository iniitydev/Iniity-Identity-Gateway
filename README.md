## The Manifesto

For too long, the domain of identity has been dominated by monolithic, all-or-nothing solutions. They are heavy, inflexible, and ill-suited for a decentralized world. The future is not a bigger monolith; it is a **symphony of specialized services**, each performing its role with precision. The challenge is not a lack of tools, but a lack of a blueprint—a coherent philosophy for orchestrating them.

**Iniity is that blueprint, brought to life.**

> "We are architecting a new paradigm where identity is not a gatekeeper, but the very fabric of your personal network reality. It's an active, intelligent, and sovereign control plane for your entire digital life. This platform is the definitive implementation of that vision."
>
> — **Aaron Lyon Phillips Lubimiv**, Founder & Chief Architect

## 📖 Essential Reading: Understanding the Vision

To fully grasp the Iniity doctrine, we have prepared two key documents:

-   **[📄 The Iniity V7 Whitepaper](./docs/WHITEPAPER_V7.md):** A high-level, promotional document that explains the philosophy, the market need, and the vision for a sovereign identity network. **Start here to understand the "Why".**
-   **[🏛️ Architecture V7 Technical Deep Dive](./docs/docs/ARCHITECTURE_V7_TECHNICAL_DEEP_DIVE.md):** A detailed technical document for architects and developers, outlining the four pillars, their interactions, and the design principles. **Read this to understand the "How".**

## ✨ Features at a Glance

The Iniity Control Plane is a multi-faceted tool for architects, developers, and end-users.

-   **🌐 Unified Digital Portal:** A seamless, single-pane-of-glass experience that unifies file management (`Desk.cx`) and identity management (`User Center`) behind a single, federated login.
-   **🎨 Multi-Modal Visualization:** Instantly switch between different views to get a complete, 360-degree picture of your identity-defined network.
    -   **Blueprint:** Visualize the high-level architecture, component roles, and their interactions.
    -   **Operations:** Monitor a real-time terminal feed of system events and audit logs.
    -   **Fleet:** View and manage the status of all connected devices in your personal network.
    -   **Policies:** Review security and access policies, and create new ones using natural language.
    -   **User Center:** Access a user-centric dashboard for managing personal profile, security settings, and active sessions.
-   **⚡ AI-Powered Insights:**
    -   **Data Flow Generation:** Witness complex processes like user onboarding unfold in real-time with step-by-step visualizations generated by the Google Gemini API.
    -   **Policy Architect:** Use natural language to generate robust, identity-aware security policies. The AI not only creates the rule but also provides a clear rationale for its configuration.
-   **🤖 AI Operator Assistant:** An integrated, context-aware chatbot that can answer deep architectural questions, grounded with Google Search for up-to-date information.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

This project is built with a modern, robust technology stack, designed for performance and developer experience.

-   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
-   **AI & Machine Learning:** Google Gemini API
-   **Project Structure:** Monorepo managed with npm Workspaces
-   **Backend Services:** Express.js, TypeScript

## 🏛️ Project Structure

This repository is a monorepo, meaning it contains multiple independent packages and applications within a single codebase. This structure helps manage dependencies and ensures consistency across the platform.

-   `webapp/`: The main React-based frontend application for the Iniity Control Plane.
-   `services/`: Contains all backend microservices.
    -   `identity-service/`: The core service for user management and identity logic (currently a stub awaiting implementation).
-   `packages/`: Shared libraries and utilities used across different parts of the monorepo.
    -   `types/`: A shared TypeScript package for common type definitions (e.g., `User`, `Policy`).
-   `docs/`: Contains all project documentation, including the whitepaper and architectural deep-dive.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To explore the Iniity Control Plane on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   npm (v9 or later)
-   A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/iniity-platform.git
    cd iniity-platform
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project is a monorepo. The following command installs dependencies for all packages from the root directory.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    The web application requires your Gemini API key. This key is provided by the execution environment as `process.env.API_KEY`. No local `.env` file is needed if running in a managed environment.

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    # This command specifically runs the 'webapp' development server
    npm run dev
    ```
    Navigate to the displayed local URL to experience the application.
